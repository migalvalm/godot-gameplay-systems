SlideShow
=========

You played videogames before don't you? Well, this node is used to create the intro presentation screen where usually the company/deb logo, tech used logos and more a put in.

It's a 2D node, and accepts only `Node2D` nodes as children (all the other will be discarded).

It has three parameters:

- `autoplay`: if set to `true` *(default)*, the slideshow will start when ready.
- `slide_duration`: how long a slide will be visible
- `slide_fade_duration`: how long a fade in or fade out will take
